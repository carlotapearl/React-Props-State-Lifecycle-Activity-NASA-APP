# React-Props-State-Lifecycle-Activity-NASA-APP
The Iron Yard 9.8 React Week 1: Props State Activity: NASA API fetch article and image, user can populate form

## Activity: React Props and State - Pair Programming
## Instructions  
In this activity you are given a simple 'NASA' react app that is broken. Right now the following events are not being handled by the react app:
form's submission
Comment text change
Author's text change
App description  

The app serves two purposes. It renders an article and image (It fetches these from the NASA API), and a user can leave a comment using a form.

## Problems to Solve  
When you fill out a comment form and press submit, the application should:
1. Append a comment to the comment listing
2. Clear out the author name and comment text upon submission

## Hints  
We've already written the handlers (`handleCommentTextChange`, `handleNameChange`, `handleFormSubmit`) for you.
Remember to set both the `onChange` and the `value` attributes for the inputs.

# Getting Started
1. Download the zip file, and place where you keep projects
2. Change directories into the project
3. Install the dependencies - npm install
4. Fire up the server - `npm start`

## Your role as a student
Articulate their ideas as best you can. Try to facilitate effective collaboration with your paired student. Be willing to debate strategies for how best to approach your challenge, but donâ€™t allow endless debate to keep you from making progress. Keep your eye on the clock and try to work yourself through the challenge at a reasonable pace. You and your partner should share the responsibility for authoring ideas and code. Finish your challenge and make certain that you call talk someone through the logic and strategies implemented by your group.
